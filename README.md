# Geometry of Integers
This repository contains two algorithms (intwordmetric and heiswordmetric) which calculate word-metrics for the integer group and for the heisenberg group of 4x4 matrices, respectively. The code was developed in collaboration with a research group at the University of Michigan, and I have attatched our write-up to this repo.
